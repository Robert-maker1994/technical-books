Architecture Shift: When and How to Decide
When to Shift Architecture
Consider a shift in architecture when observing one or more of the following:
 * Observations from the Past: Review past architectural decisions and their outcomes. Identify recurring issues or limitations that suggest a need for change.
 * Changes in Ecosystem: The broader technological or business ecosystem may evolve, making the current architecture less effective. This includes shifts in customer behavior, market trends, or regulatory requirements.
 * New Capabilities: The emergence of new technologies, tools, or patterns may offer significant advantages that the current architecture cannot easily leverage.
 * Acceleration: If the current architecture hinders the speed of development, deployment, or innovation, a shift might be necessary to accelerate progress.
 * Domain Changes: Significant changes in the business domain, such as new product lines, business models, or customer segments, may necessitate architectural adjustments.
 * Technology Changes: Evolution in underlying technologies (e.g., programming languages, databases, cloud platforms) can create opportunities or impose constraints that demand architectural re-evaluation.
 * External Factors: External influences like competitor moves, economic shifts, or new security threats can trigger a need for architectural change.
Decision Criteria for Architecture Shifts
When deciding whether and how to shift architecture, an architect should consider:
 * Domain Knowledge: A deep understanding of the business domain is crucial. The architecture must align with business goals and processes.
 * Architecture Characteristics: Evaluate the current and desired architectural characteristics (e.g., scalability, reliability, security, maintainability). The new architecture should address shortcomings and enhance desired qualities.
 * Data Architecture: Analyze the impact on data storage, processing, and access. Data migration, consistency, and governance are key considerations.
 * Organization Factors: Consider the organizational structure, team capabilities, and cultural readiness for change. An architecture shift often requires corresponding organizational adjustments.
 * Domain/Architecture Isomorphism: Strive for an architecture that mirrors the structure and relationships within the business domain, promoting clarity and maintainability.
 * Monolith Versus Distributed: Carefully weigh the trade-offs between monolithic and distributed architectures. This involves considering complexity, deployment, scaling, and team autonomy.
TOP TIP
Use synchronous by default, asynchronous when necessary. This principle encourages simpler, more predictable interactions unless the specific requirements (e.g., long-running processes, decoupled services, resilience) clearly dictate the need for asynchronous communication.
