# Architecture Decisions

## Purpose

This document outlines the significance of architecture decisions in software systems, highlights common decision-making anti-patterns, and explains how to document these decisions effectively using Architectural Decision Records (ADRs).

## What Are Architecture Decisions?

Architecture decisions are high-impact choices regarding the structure and behavior of a software system. They involve selecting frameworks, architectural patterns, deployment strategies, and more. Good architecture decisions ensure the system is:

- Scalable
- Maintainable
- Performant
- Aligned with business goals

## Architecture Decision Anti-Patterns

### 1. Covering Your Assets

**Description**:  
Making overly conservative decisions primarily to avoid blame rather than deliver the best solution.

**Symptoms**:
- Choosing "enterprise-approved" tools over better options
- Avoiding innovation due to fear of failure

**Impact**:
- Leads to stagnation and missed opportunities
- Reinforces status quo bias in technical decisions

---

### 2. Groundhog Day

**Description**:  
Repeating the same decision-making process for every project without learning from past experiences.

**Symptoms**:
- No reusable decision templates or knowledge base
- Rehashing debates on every new project

**Impact**:
- Wasted time
- Inconsistent decisions across teams

---

### 3. Email-Driven Architecture

**Description**:  
Architecture decisions are made informally via email, chats, or hallway conversations with no formal documentation.

**Symptoms**:
- No traceability of decisions
- Key decisions lost in communication channels

**Impact**:
- Lack of transparency and historical context
- Hard to onboard new team members

---

### 4. The Captain

**Description**:  
One person unilaterally makes all architecture decisions.

**Impact**:
- Lack of team engagement
- Potential for narrow, biased solutions

---

### 5. The Bystander

**Description**:  
Everyone assumes someone else is responsible for decisions.

**Impact**:
- Architecture emerges by accident
- Lack of strategic direction

---

### 6. The Hydra

**Description**:  
Too many people try to contribute to every decision.

**Impact**:
- Analysis paralysis
- Incoherent architecture

---

### 7. The Prisoner

**Description**:  
Decisions are restricted to existing tools and technologies.

**Impact**:
- Missed chances to improve
- Technical debt builds up

---

### 8. The Aesthete

**Description**:  
Prioritizing elegance over functionality or pragmatism.

**Impact**:
- Architectures that are theoretically beautiful but impractical

## Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

### What Are ADRs?

ADRs are short documents that capture important architectural decisions, including the context and reasoning behind them.

### ADR Template

```text
# [Decision Title]

## Status
Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded

## Context
Why is this decision necessary? What problem is it solving?

## Decision
What choice has been made?

## Consequences
What are the implications of this decisionâ€”both positive and negative?
